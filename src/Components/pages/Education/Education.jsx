          <p>
            I am currently pursuing my degree in Computer Science and
            Engineering, where I am building a strong foundation in programming,
            software development, and emerging technologies. However, much of my
            learning extends beyond the classroom, driven by my curiosity and
            determination to explore independently.
            <br />
            <br />
            As a self-taught learner, I take the initiative to deepen my
            understanding of various technologies and tools, often going beyond
            the standard curriculum to work on real-world projects and acquire
            new skills. <br /> <br />
